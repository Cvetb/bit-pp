The goal of this exercise is to write a code for the web application that helps with the exam statistics. 

The application should be developed with the following use-case scenario in mind. Firstly, a user can select the name of the subject from the select list provided in the left part of the form. Then, the user can type in the name and surname of the student. Finally, the user can select a grade from the list provided in the right part of the form. When the user clicks on the ADD button, the information about the student and the subject appears in the list titled passed or failed depending on their score. Synchronously, the exam statistics in the page header is updated. That is the number of students that have passed the exam, and both the number and the percentage of the students who have failed the exam.

If the provided input is not valid, appropriate error messages should be shown. 
Both name and surname should be provided and both should start with capitals. The grade should be a valid numerical value from 1 to 10.
